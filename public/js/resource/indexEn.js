    aboutMeText: `Hi, my name is <span>Rodrigo R. Chagas</span>, I'm a 22
    year old web developer currently focused on backend development with
    <span>Asp.Net</span>. I was 19 when I first met the programming world as I was
    coursing a college subject that demanded me to set my sight on learning the basics
    of <span>C++</span> and, later, <span>Python</span>. Since then, I have been
    studying to increase my knowledge as a developer, expanded my horizon and learned
    how to create
    responsive web pages with <span>HTML 5</span>, <span>CSS 3</span>,
    <span>Bootstrap</span> and
    <span>JavaScript</span>.<br>In the second half of 2021, I put all my effort into
    learning more and more about this vast world of technology and, as I went
    thexperirough new ences exploring projects like a <span>Login System</span>,
    <span>Bank System</span>,
    <span>Crawler</span> application and built and sent request to some
    <span>APIs</span>
    to name a few, as I'll present them in this project.<br>
    Amongst the technologies I have experience with, here are some of them:
    <span>SQLServer</span>, <span>RabbitMQ</span>, <span>Elasticsearch</span>,
    <span>Kibana</span>, <span>MLS</span>, <span>Amazon Web Services</span>, <span>Azure
    DevOpps</span> and <span>Blobb Storage</span>, <span>Git and GitHub</span> and
    I've been a <span>QA
        Analyst</span> too.<br>
    Here are some of the .NET features and frameworks that I feel comfortable working
    with: <span>Cookies management</span>, <span>Identity</span>, <span>Entity
        Framework</span>, <span>Razor/Blazor pages</span>, <span>Jwt
        Tokens</span>, <span>API REST</span>, <span>authentication</span> and
    <span>authorization</span>, it's
    fair to point out that I have knowledge on <span>DDD</span> and <span>TDD</span>
    patterns, <span>Object Oriented programming Paradigm</span>, plus a solid base on
    <span>SOLID</span>.<br>
    On August 2022 I joined "Employer" as an intern, and I'm still working there at the
    moment as part of the BNE squad, where I learned how a big company development
    environment works, how to deal with and solve problems.<br>
    Besides programming and it's huge world of possibilities, some of my qualities I can
    name briefly are: I'm an <span>fully English speaker</span> and that I see myself as
    a hustler, proactive man who never gives up and loves to breakdown complicated
    situations and handle them properly, that's what I do since forever and want to
    continue doing it.`,
    experienceTitle: `EXPERIENCE`,
    experienceText: `Before entering the software business I used to work as a <span>Meter Reader</span>, at
    Tellus
    , from January of 2020 to April 2021, going from house to house, talking to hundreds of
    people and handing their light bill.
    There I learned how to communicate better, exercised my empathy, my patience (delivering
    debts to people is not easy), but
    mostly how to value work and take it as seriously as possible.<br>
    Currently I am working at Employer, as a intern and part of the BNE squad, which detains 2
    of the 2 biggest website of Human Resources
    in Brazil. There I got to experience how to deal with software in a professional level, as
    I: delivered some projects
    (<span>Catalog, CRUD, Shopping Cart</span>), collaborated to a new <span>tool of
        management</span> of one of the company's websites, had contact with the company's
    <span>Crawler</span> (gets jobs from other sites and publishes them in our) using XPath
    expressions to get analysis of HTML or XML files and collecting
    data, indexed files into a <span>LMS</span> website using <span>AWS services</span>,
    documented and did test cases of pretty much the whole BNE site as QA Analyst,
    and solved quick fix bugs by altering fields in the production database.`
