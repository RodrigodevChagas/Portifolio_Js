    aboutMeText: `
    Hello, my name is <span>Rodrigo R. Chagas</span>, and I am a 23-year-old web developer currently focused on backend development with  <span>Asp.Net</span>.
    My journey into the programming world began when I was 19 and taking a college subject that required me to learn the basics of <span>C++</span> and <span>Python</span>.
    Since then, I have been continuously expanding my knowledge and skills as a developer.<br>

    I have experience in creating responsive web pages with <span>HTML 5</span>, <span>CSS 3</span>, <span>Bootstrap</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>.
    In the second half of 2021, I dedicated myself to learning more about the vast world of technology.
    Through my experiences working on projects such as a <span>Login System</span>, <span>Bank System</span>, and <span>Crawler</span> application,
    and sending requests to various <span>APIs</span>, I have gained valuable experience that I will present in this project.

    My experience includes working with a variety of technologies such as <span>SQLServer</span>, <span>RabbitMQ</span>, <span>Elasticsearch</span>,
    <span>Kibana</span>, <span>MLS</span>, <span>Amazon Web Services</span>, <span>Azure DevOpps</span> and <span>Blobb Storage</span>,
    <span>Git and GitHub</span>. Additionally, I have worked as a <span>QA Analyst</span>.<br>

    I am comfortable working with several .NET features and frameworks, including <span>Cookies management</span>, <span>Identity</span>, <span>Entity
    Framework</span>, <span>Razor/Blazor pages</span>, <span>Jwt
    Tokens</span>, <span>API REST</span>, <span>authentication</span> and <span>authorization</span>. It's worth noting that I have knowledge of <span>DDD</span> and <span>TDD</span> patterns,
    <span>Object-Oriented programming Paradigm</span>, and a solid base on <span>SOLID</span>.<br>

    I joined "Employer" in August 2022 as an intern and am currently part of the BNE squad. Working at a large company has given me
    valuable experience on how a development environment operates and how to solve and manage problems.<br>

    Apart from programming, some of my qualities include being a <span>fluent English speaker</span> and a proactive, persistent individual
    who excels at breaking down complicated situations and handling them efficiently. This is something that I have always
    enjoyed doing and wish to continue doing in the future.`,
    experienceTitle: `EXPERIENCE`,
    experienceText: `
    Prior to entering the software industry, I worked as a <span>Meter Reader</span> at Tellus from January 2020 to April 2021. My job involved visiting households, interacting with people,
    and handing over their electricity bills. This experience taught me the importance of effective communication, empathy, patience, and most importantly, the value of work and taking it seriously.<br>

    Currently, I am interning at Employer, where I am a part of the BNE squad. Employer is one of the leading human resource websites in Brazil. During my time here,
    I have had the opportunity to work on various projects such as <span>Catalog</span>, <span>CRUD</span>, and <span>Shopping Cart</span>, collaborate on a new website management tool, work with the company's <span>Crawler</span>
    using <span>XPath</span> expressions to analyze <span>HTML</span> or <span>XML</span> files and collect data, index files into a <span>LMS</span> website using AWS services, and document and perform test cases of the entire BNE site as a <span>QA Analyst</span>.
    In addition, I have been able to fix quick bugs by modifying fields in the production database using <span>SQL</span> and develop with <span>.NET</span>. I am proficient in <span>HTML</span>, <span>C#</span>, <span>Python</span>, <span>C++</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>.
