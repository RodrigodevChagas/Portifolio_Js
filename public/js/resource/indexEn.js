    aboutMeText: `
    Hello, my name is <span>Rodrigo R. Chagas</span>, and I am a 23-year-old web developer currently focused on backend development with  <span>Asp.Net</span>.
    My journey into the programming world began when I was 19 and taking a college subject that required me to learn the basics of <span>C++</span> and <span>Python</span>.
    Since then, I have been continuously expanding my knowledge and skills as a developer.<br>

    I have experience in creating responsive web pages with <span>HTML 5</span>, <span>CSS 3</span>, <span>Bootstrap</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>.
    In the second half of 2021, I dedicated myself to learning more about the vast world of technology.
    Through my experiences working on projects such as a <span>Login System</span>, <span>Bank System</span>, and <span>Crawler</span> application,
    and sending requests to various <span>APIs</span>, I have gained valuable experience that I will present in this project.

    My experience includes working with a variety of technologies such as <span>SQLServer</span>, <span>RabbitMQ</span>, <span>Elasticsearch</span>,
    <span>Kibana</span>, <span>MLS</span>, <span>Amazon Web Services</span>, <span>Azure DevOpps</span> and <span>Blobb Storage</span>,
    <span>Git and GitHub</span>. Additionally, I have worked as a <span>QA Analyst</span>.<br>

    I am comfortable working with several .NET features and frameworks, including <span>Cookies management</span>, <span>Identity</span>, <span>Entity
    Framework</span>, <span>Razor/Blazor pages</span>, <span>Jwt
    Tokens</span>, <span>API REST</span>, <span>authentication</span> and <span>authorization</span>. It's worth noting that I have knowledge of <span>DDD</span> and <span>TDD</span> patterns,
    <span>Object-Oriented programming Paradigm</span>, and a solid base on <span>SOLID</span>.<br>

    I joined "Employer" in August 2022 as an intern and am currently part of the BNE squad. Working at a large company has given me
    valuable experience on how a development environment operates and how to solve and manage problems.<br>

    Apart from programming, some of my qualities include being a <span>fluent English speaker</span> and a proactive, persistent individual
    who excels at breaking down complicated situations and handling them efficiently. This is something that I have always
    enjoyed doing and wish to continue doing in the future.`,
    experienceTitle: `EXPERIENCE`,
    experienceText: `Before entering the software business I used to work as a <span>Meter Reader</span>, at
    Tellus
    , from January of 2020 to April 2021, going from house to house, talking to hundreds of
    people and handing their light bill.
    There I learned how to communicate better, have empathy, and to be patience (delivering
    debts to people is not easy), but
    mostly how to value work and take it as seriously as possible.<br>
    Currently I am working at Employer, as a intern and part of the BNE squad, which detains 2
    of the 2 biggest website of Human Resources
    in Brazil. There I got to experience how to deal with software in a professional level, as
    I: delivered some projects <span>Catalog, CRUD, Shopping Cart</span>, collaborated to a new <span>tool of
    management</span> of one of the company's websites, had contact with the company's
    <span>Crawler</span> (gets jobs from other sites and publishes them in our) using XPath
    expressions to get analysis of HTML or XML files and collecting
    data, indexed files into a <span>LMS</span> website using <span>AWS services</span>,
    documented and did test cases of pretty much the whole BNE site as QA Analyst,
    solved quick fix bugs by altering fields in the production database using <span>SQL</span>
    and mainly developing with <span>.NET</span>.`,
